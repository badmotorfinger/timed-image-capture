# timed-image-capture

I have placed the ESP32 device in the bush while camping using a 32GB card. It is also hooked up to a battery which is solar powered which will hopefully keep it powered.

I have equiped the ESP32 with a 32GB SD card which has enough space to capture an image every 60 seconds for an entire year. Looking forward to some interesting finds!
